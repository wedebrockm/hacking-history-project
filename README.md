# Quick Project Overview

This project is an attempt to utilize digital methodologies to classical text analysis.  By using webscrabing, scrubbing, and other organizational programs, I hope to tackle a relatively complex text in the *Pro Caelio* in a short period of time.  The goal is to show that digital methodologies have a positive impact on "traditional" history projects, even at the individual level.  It is my hope that by completing this task I show that digital methodologies are not some arcane, complex shift in the field, but instead another tool to be used by good historians in order to obtain their best research results.
