# Methodology and Digital Applications

In order to apply any kind of digital practice to an analysis of the *Pro Caelio*, the text first needed to be scraped off of a site using a non-copyrighted version of the text.  The Perseus collection seemed the most logical choice for this as it was already curated in a reasonably accessible format and used a non-copyrighted version of the *Pro Caelio*.  There were downsides in choosing to use Perseus’s archive, as it unfortunately uses older versions of most texts, but the upsides of accessibility and its status as a curated university database were worthy reasons to offset this weakness. Further, since I needed to obtain an uncopyrighted version of the oration, anything I would obtain would have to be relatively outdated as a text anyway, so this shortcoming was not as great as one might initially suppose. Finally, as this is mostly a proof-of-concept for measuring the zeitgeist of Cicero’s language more so than an extremely close textual analysis, the problem of the version’s age was largely mitigated.

So that others can easily test and apply my methodology, I will be explicit in recounting it. Using the freeware, *Web Scraper* in Google’s *Chrome* browser, one can scrape the text off Perseus’s website, first by identifying the text they would like to scrape on the page and adding it as a selector, then by identifying the links that the scraper would cycle through as an additional selector. One then simply needs to make a copy of the text selector and place it within the branch of the link selector. The *Web Scraper* can then be activated and it will scrape the text.
