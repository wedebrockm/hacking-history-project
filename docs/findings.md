# Findings

The final tally noting the juxtaposition of passive-active verbs and the function of prosecutor’s and defender’s names as subjects (or subject-modifying) or objects (or object-modifying) in Cicero’s syntax can be seen in the table below.   It should be noted that since the aim of this work was to use the text search functions to their utmost, Cicero’s references to these characters without explicit mention of their names were not included in the final tally.

While the above note is an enormous caveat, that would be the work of a much larger project, perhaps one that also included a more detailed analysis of the context in which these dynamics ensued.  Still, there are some cases from this sample that are worth mentioning.  Explicit mentions of Clodia and Atratinius are only mentioned as objects. The only exception to this rule is when Clodia’s name appears with Caelius.  This placement as an object might have enhanced Cicero’s invective.  While this is a curious phenomenon, without a deeper look at when Clodia is referenced as a pronoun rather than by name, this trend remains inconclusive due to sample size.  This assumption also seems more doubtful when one notes that Caelius’ name often appears as an object.

Overall, rather than revealing as much about Cicero’s use of the active and passive voice in his invective, these numbers more depict...
