# Historiography

Text-based projects formed the basis for some of the earliest projects that utilized digital methodologies. At first, digitizing endangered texts were the focus of scholars’ and archivists’ efforts, preserving works that would be lost either due to the last copy’s fragile condition, or from their location in geo-politically unstable regions.  As the field increased in size, the application of digital tools expanded into analyses of the texts themselves.  As a result, the precedent for my own research into invective has already been set by other projects, such as one launched by the University of Chicago that examined the invective of American and non-American playwrights in black drama through a combination of text mining and machine learning.   This growth in the discipline reflects the increasing size and importance of digital methods in mainstream, scholarly history, in the face of such momentous works my hope in inserting myself into the discipline is merely to reinforce the idea that these emerging methods can help even in smaller doses to make traditional linguistic analyses more achievable at the individual level.
